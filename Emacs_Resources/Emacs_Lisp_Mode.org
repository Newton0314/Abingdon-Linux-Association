#+TITLE: Emacs Lisp & Common lisp mode
#+AUTHOR: Frank She

* Intro
For consistency purposes, Emacs Lisp is referred as elisp and common lisp is referred as lisp from this point onwards.
  
** Evaluation of Code 
- Use the following command to enter the lisp interactive environment (similar to the Python console)   

#+begin_src shell
M-x lisp-interaction-mode
#+end_src

- And run the following command in terminal to compile FILE as elisp script

#+begin_src shell
emacs --script FILE
#+end_src

Or use *M-x evaluate buffer*

- Evaluating a single expression of elisp
Place the cursor after the last closed bracket of the expression, and evaluate it using *C-j*, the results will be printed in *scratch*.

Alternatively, the results will be printed in a mini-buffer using *C-x C-e*, or using *M-C-x* with the cursor inside the expression.
