#+TITLE:  Emacs Python Mode
#+Author: Frank

* Set up & Intro
Please add the following lines into the .emacs file:

#+begin_src elisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
    'org-babel-load-languages
	'((python . t)))
#+end_src

** Basic Commands[fn:1: https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-python.html#orgc2ff2f6] (including commands for JEDI & Flycheck)
 - C-c C-p :: staring a python shell/process (equivalent to *M-x run-python*)
 - C-c C-c :: evaluate the current code block (equivalent to *M-x python-shell-send-buffer*)
 - C-c ' :: staring a separate python buffer in Org mode src
 - M-x flyckeck-list-errors :: displaying a list of errors in the current buffer    
  
*** Calling a function defined in another source code block [fn:2: https://orgmode.org/manual/Evaluating-Code-Blocks.html]
 Basic syntax: 
 #+begin_src python 
 #+CALL: <name>(<arguments>)
 #+CALL: <name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>) <end header arguments>
 #+end_src

 Note: For a source block to be called explicitly at somewhere else in the document, the source code block must be named using the 
 syntax:
 #+begin_src python 
#+NAME:
 #+end_src

 For instance, this is a source code block named 'Addition'
 #+NAME: Addition
 #+begin_src python :result
 t = a + b
 return t
 #+end_src

 And we can call this source block by using the following command:
 #+begin_src python
 #+CALL: Addition(a=2, b=3)

 #+RESULTS:
 : 5
 #+end_src

 which returns 5


** Importing modules 

*** Problems encountered
 When importing matplolib in emacs python source code using the following command

 #+begin_src python
 import matplotlib
 #+end_src  

 ImportError occurred

*** Methods attempted
**** Importing the modules using the absolute directory 
*** Possible problems
*** Solution 
 Installing the packages from terminal using *sudo apt-get install* instead of *pip*


* Plugins
** JEDI (Python auto-completion)

*** Installation [fn:3:http://tkf.github.io/emacs-jedi/latest/]

*** Problem Encountered
 After a new .py file is created, an error message appeared reporting "JEDI disabled in the current buffer" 
 and I was suggested to use the command

 #+begin_src 
 M-x jedi:install-server
 #+end_src

 Another error message appears: "No program named virtualenv [fn:4:https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/]"   

*** Attempts
 I tried installing virtualenv via the terminal using 

 #+begin_src shell
 pip install virtualenv
 #+end_src

 But again, pip appears to be self-contained, thus the package can't be loaded in Emacs    

*** Solutions
 Use the following command instead  

 #+begin_src shell
 sudo apt install virtualenv
 #+end_src


*** Advanced Usage                                               :Unmodified:
 - The time interval between when the user stops typing and when the auto-complete is activated

**** Enabling Python Auto-completion in Org Mode Source Code Blocks
 Use *C-c '* to start a Python buffer, and python codes can be completed as usual.


** Flyckeck (Python syntax-checker)

*** Installation [fn:5:https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/installation.html]
Please add the following codes to the .emacs or the equivalent init file

#+begin_src elisp 
(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("MELPA Stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

After the repository is set up, flycheck can be installed using the commands as follows

#+begin_src  
M-x package-refresh-contents

M-x package-install RET flycheck
#+end_src

After flyckeck has been installed, it can be permanently enabled by adding the following code in to the init file

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-flycheck-mode)
#+end_src

And *language-specific* syntax checker programs can be downloaded separately. *Pylint* [fn:6:https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/quickstart.html] 
is recommended for python syntax checking and can be installed using the following command in the terminal.

#+begin_src shell
pip install pylint
#+end_src

*** Display and interaction with errors 
- Display and list errors [fn:7:https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/error-list.html]
- Interaction with errors [fn:8:https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/error-interaction.html]
