# Welcome!

A Very Warm Welcome to the **Abingdon Linux Association** [^1]!

We aim to create an inspirational and friendly environment for all Linux enthusiasts to discuss, share and communicate their experiences, various encountered problems and the corresponding solutions under Linux as well as promoting the **Spirituality of Open Source**.   

# Organisational Culture
Please note that the majority of our discussions and solutions are highly individualised and specific.

We follow the Philosophy of Unix [^2] to "**Do One Thing, and Do It Well**".

Due to the high resemblance of Linux-oriented tutorials materials but the lack of detailed and specific follow-ups, some specific uncovered topics are particularly time-consuming and inefficient to learn and understand, resulting in an steep overall learning curve for Linux and its derivative products. 

Therefore, the objective of Abingdon Linux Association is to provide high-quality solutions to specific unsolved problems and fill the gap in the large framework of Linux official documentations.
